Decision Support App for Crime Investigatory Report in Angeles City

This is a project I decided to take for the thesis of some students from my alma matter for some extra pocket money to go on vacation.

This is my first Firebase project, and my second Ionic project.


Resources:

- https://ionicframework.com/docs/components/ (And the github links of the demo sources)
- https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/building-a-ionic-firebase-app-step-by-step (Follow links to other tutorials to learn it all)

To Do:

- Improve filtering code, at the moment I call a method for each key to filter, need to improve this to multi-key filtering
- Dynamic Data retrieval, only retrieve finite data, add pagnation or infinite scrolling, at the moment the app pulls in all data. This will be affect performance once there's a significant amount of data.
